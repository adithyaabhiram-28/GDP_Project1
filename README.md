# Top 10 Largest Economies by GDP (Nominal)



This is my first basic Jupyter Notebook project. It extracts and processes GDP data from a Wikipedia page archived on the Wayback Machine.



\## ðŸ“Š What It Does



\- Scrapes the GDP (nominal) table from Wikipedia using `pandas.read\_html`

\- Extracts the top 10 countries by nominal GDP

\- Converts GDP from millions to billions

\- Saves the result as a CSV file: `largest\_economies.csv`



\## ðŸ“¦ Requirements



To run the notebook, make sure you have the following Python packages:



```bash

pip install pandas numpy lxml
